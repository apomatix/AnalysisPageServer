\usage{
simple.param(name, label = name, description = label, value = "",
  type = "text", advanced = 0, show.if = NULL, display.callback = NULL,
  size = "medium", required = TRUE, persistent = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{name}{Name of form element}

\item{label}{Label for form element (typically rendered to the left of the element)}

\item{description}{Description for form element (typically rendered as roll-over text)}

\item{value}{The default, starting value, for the form (default: "")}

\item{type}{Type of form element. This can be "text", "textarea", "checkbox", "password" or "file"}

\item{advanced}{Integer. 0 means the option is not advanced, and increasing levels indicate the option
is for more advanced users. Advanced > 0 should be hidden under default mode.}

\item{show.if}{A list of two elements: \code{$name}, giving the name of some other param in the set
and \code{$values}, a character vector of values. The parameter under construction should only be shown if
the named parameter takes on any of the values in the \code{$values} vector. Default (NULL) is to always
show the parameter under construction.}

\item{display.callback}{NULL, to follow \code{show.if} logic in deciding when/if
to display the element, or a list with the two elements \code{$uri} and \code{$dependent},
which follow the same format as the corresponding arguments to \code{combobox.param} and provide
a templated uri and a mapping from template variables to form parameters. The service should
return JSON true if the widget is to be shown and false if not. It is allowed to
have both a \code{display.callback} and a \code{show.if}---both conditions must be
met in order to display the element.}

\item{size}{A word giving the size of the element. The interpretation of this size is up to the front-end.
Must from a defined set of words, which you can see by calling \code{known.param.sizes()} (currently
no way to change this). Default: medium}

\item{required}{Logical. Is this a required param? Default: TRUE. If set, then the front-end will
the front-end user is required to set this parameter before submitting the request. The meaning of
"set this parameter" is not entirely clear.}

\item{persistent}{Character or NULL. If non-NULL then it is passed to the front-end. It names a
variable in persistent storage that should be used to initialize the value of the parameter.
The front end will provide some mechanism to change the persistent value, but until the user does
so the param will be initialized from the value in the persistent space.}
