# Installation instructions

## Rook dependency

For Rook deployment users will need version at least 1.1.

As of September 2014 this is not available on CRAN and must
be installed from github:

```
library(devtools)
install_github('Rook','jeffreyhorner')
```

Once available on CRAN this step will be unnecessary.

You can still use most of the functionality of AnalysisPageServer without
Rook. In particular, if you only want to make static reports you don't need
it, and even if you are going to turn on a server, you don't need Rook to
deploy via FastRWeb or Apache.

## Running on windows

I've set `OS_type: unix` because I've never tested the package on windows,
only on OS X and linux. It is possible that it might be
at least partially functional under windows.
